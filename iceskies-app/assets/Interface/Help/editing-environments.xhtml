        <h2>Options</h2>

        The options window lets you change various settings which affect performance and visual
        quality. If it's running slow for you, or you wish to see what the scene looks like
        with other settings, play with stuff in here.

        <h2>Other Goodies</h2>

        Press F12 to toggle recording MJPEG videos to <b>HOME%/Documents/Iceskies/Videos</b> (probably 
        will need processing in an editor before uploading).
